**CORAL** is an infrastructure for building organizations of **autonomous AI agents** that run experiments, share knowledge, and continuously improve solutions. Give it a codebase and a grading script, and Coral handles the rest: isolated workspaces, safe evaluation, persistent shared knowledge, and multi-agent collaboration to enable robust evolution. Coral is natively integrated with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and other major coding agents.

Want self-improving AI without the configuration overhead? Try Coral.



### 🔥 News!

- **[2026-03-18]** CORAL is released! Check out our [blog post](https://human-agent-society.github.io/CORAL/).

![Demo](assets/demo.gif)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Human-Agent-Society/CORAL.git
cd CORAL
# install uv from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv
uv sync                   # (optionally add --extra ui to include dashboard dependencies)
```

### Supported Agents

Coral works with any coding agent that can run as a subprocess and interact via the terminal. Currently supported:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [**Claude Code**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) | Anthropic's agentic coding tool — the default and most tested runtime |
| [**Codex**](https://github.com/openai/codex) | OpenAI's open-source coding agent |
| [**OpenCode**](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) | Open-source terminal-based AI coding agent |

> [!TIP]
> Before using Coral, make sure you have fully set up the agent(s) you plan to use:
>
> - **Install the Agent:** Follow the official installation instructions for your agent (e.g., Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode). This may involve installing packages, setting up executables, or configuring scripts.
> - **Authentication:** Login and authenticate your coding agent first to make sure they do not ask for your credentials in CLI mode. Set up any required environment variables, configuration files, or authentication secrets as specified in your agent's documentation.
> - **Set Permissions:** Configure your agent's permission settings via its config file (e.g., `~/.claude/settings.json` for Claude Code) to control which tools, file paths, or actions it is allowed to perform.
>
> *Coral does not handle agent installation or authentication for you. The infrastructure will fail to function if the underlying agent cannot start or is not properly authenticated.*

Set the agent in your task config (refer to <a href="#3-configure-the-task">Configure the task</a>):

```yaml
agents:
  runtime: claude_code   # or "codex" or "opencode"
  count: 3  # how many agents you want to spawn. Beware of your budget :)
  model: opus   # name of the model you wish to use
```

### Usage

```bash
# start a run
uv run coral start --config examples/kernel_builder/task.yaml

# stop and resume
uv run coral stop                                      # stop anytime
uv run coral resume                                    # pick up where you left off

# monitor progress
uv run coral ui                                        # open the web dashboard
```

### How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/coral_diagram_trans.jpg" alt="Coral Architecture Diagram" width="800">
</p>

Each agent runs in its own git worktree branch. Shared state (attempts, notes, skills) lives in `.coral/public/` and is symlinked into every worktree — agents see each other's work in real time with zero sync overhead. The manager watches for new attempts and can interrupt agents with heartbeat-triggered prompts (e.g. "reflect", "consolidate skills").

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Agents as optimizers** | Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode subprocesses, each in its own git worktree |
| **Shared state** | `.coral/` directory with attempts, notes, and skills — symlinked into every worktree |
| **Eval loop** | Agents call `uv run coral eval -m "..."` to stage, commit, and grade in one shot |
| **CLI orchestration** | 17+ commands: `start`, `stop`, `status`, `eval`, `log`, `ui`, and more |
| **Web dashboard** | `uv run coral ui` — real-time leaderboard, attempt diffs, agent monitoring |

### Quick Start

Let's walk through a complete example: agents continually optimize a **100-city Traveling Salesman Problem**.

#### 1. Write a seed codebase

The seed is the starting code that agents will iterate on. Create a working directory:

```bash
mkdir -p examples/tsp/{seed,eval}
```

Then create a naive initial solution (you can choose to start empty, though it can make the job of the agents harder):

```python
# examples/tsp/seed/solution.py
import random

# Restate the problem here as the agent cannot read the content of `grader.py`
random.seed(42)
CITIES = [(random.random(), random.random()) for _ in range(100)]

# Naive: visit cities in index order (0, 1, 2, ..., 99)
for i in range(len(CITIES)):
    print(i)
```

#### 2. Write a grader

Subclass `TaskGrader` and implement `evaluate()`. The base class provides two helpers: `self.run_program(filename)` which runs a file from the agent's codebase in a subprocess and returns a `CompletedProcess` (with `.stdout`, `.stderr`, `.returncode`), and `self.fail(reason)` which records the failure and returns a null score:

```python
# examples/tsp/eval/grader.py
import math
import random
from coral.grader import TaskGrader, ScoreBundle

# keep consistent with the problem statement in `solution.py`
random.seed(42)
CITIES = [(random.random(), random.random()) for _ in range(100)]

class Grader(TaskGrader):
    def evaluate(self) -> float | ScoreBundle:
        try:
            result = self.run_program("solution.py")  # runs solution.py, returns CompletedProcess
            order = [int(x) for x in result.stdout.strip().split("\n")]
            assert sorted(order) == list(range(len(CITIES)))
            dist = sum(
                math.dist(CITIES[order[i]], CITIES[order[(i + 1) % len(order)]])
                for i in range(len(order))
            )
            return -dist  # shorter tour = higher score
        except Exception as e:
            return self.fail(str(e))  # records failure and returns null score
```

The naive seed tour scores about `-58.02`. Agents will try nearest-neighbor, 2-opt, simulated annealing, etc. to find shorter routes. With 100 cities, exhaustive search is completely infeasible (99! permutations), so agents must discover and apply real optimization heuristics.

#### 3. Configure the task

Point the config at your seed codebase and grader:

```yaml
# examples/tsp/task.yaml
task:
  name: tsp
  description: |
    Find the shortest round-trip tour through 100 cities. The coordinates
    are generated via numpy with a fixed seed in `solution.py`. DO NOT MODIFY the seed or CITIES generation!

    solution.py must print 100 integers (0-99) to stdout, one per line,
    representing the visit order. Each city must appear exactly once.

    The grader computes the total Euclidean round-trip distance
    and returns -distance as the score (shorter = higher).

grader:
  type: function
  module: eval.grader

agents:
  count: 1
  runtime: claude_code  # or opencode, codex
  model: claude-sonnet-4-6
  max_turns: 200  # before the agent reboots. dont worry Coral keeps running until you stop

workspace:
  results_dir: "./results"  # relative to your $PWD
  repo_path: "./examples/tsp/seed"  # relative to your $PWD
```

#### 4. Launch

```bash
uv run coral start --config examples/tsp/task.yaml  # You should then see Coral in tmux session `coral-tsp`
uv sync --extra ui && uv run coral ui          # Open web dashboard, default to run on port 8420
uv run coral status      # CLI leaderboard
uv run coral log         # View attempts
uv run coral stop        # Stop all agents
```
